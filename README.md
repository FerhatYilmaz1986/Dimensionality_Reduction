# Dimensionality reduction techniques with Pyhton; 
  Dimensionality reduction is a technique that reduce the size of data(for high dimensional datasets) while keeping the most important information.  
  ### Components of dimensionality reduction:  
    -Feature Selection  
    -Feature Extraction  
      
  ### Some examples of dimensionality reduction:
    -Principal Component Analysis(PCA)    
    -Kernal PCA  
    -Linear Discriminant Analysis  
      
## Implementation:

    -Appying PCA to find the number of components  
    -Applying PCA with 2 components  
    -Applying KernelPCA  
    -Applying LDA
